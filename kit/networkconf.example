# For static addressing, each network/vlan combination needs to be
# explicitly stated, otherwise we assume DHCP is available. The syntax can
# be seen in the example below. For the 'non-vlan' case, the vlan Id should
# be 0, i.e.:
#	static_0_0 = 192.168.0.2,192.168.0.10,255.255.255.0,192.168.0.1

# static_<network _id>_<vlan_id> = <ip_start>,<ip_end>,<netmask>,<gw>

# Setting static addressing for VLAN 200 on Network ID 0:
static_0_200 = 192.168.0.2,192.168.0.10,255.255.255.0,192.168.0.1
